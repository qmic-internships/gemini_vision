# Gemini Vision MVP - Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Traditional computer vision applications require specialized knowledge and complex setup to understand visual content. Users need an intuitive way to:
- Get instant scene understanding from their device camera
- Identify and classify objects in real-time
- Receive contextual information about their visual environment
- Access advanced AI vision capabilities without technical complexity

## Solution

A mobile application that transforms any smartphone into an intelligent vision assistant, providing real-time scene analysis through Google's Gemini AI.

## Application Intent

**Primary Goal**: Democratize computer vision by making advanced AI accessible through a simple camera interface.

**Use Cases**:
- **Educational**: Students can point their camera at objects to learn about them
- **Accessibility**: Visually impaired users can get audio descriptions of their surroundings
- **Professional**: Field workers can quickly identify and catalog items
- **General Public**: Anyone curious about their visual environment

## System Flow

### 1. Input Capture
- **Source**: Device camera (front/back)
- **Format**: High-resolution JPEG images
- **Modes**: 
  - Single capture (user-triggered)
  - Continuous stream (every 2 seconds)

### 2. API Integration

**Endpoint**: Google Generative AI API  
**Model**: `gemini-pro-vision`  
**Authentication**: API Key-based

**Request Structure**:
```
POST /generateContent
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]
  - Content-Type: application/json

Payload:
  - Image: Base64-encoded JPEG
  - Prompt: Structured analysis request
  - Config: Temperature, token limits
```

### 3. Prompt Engineering

**Analysis Prompt**:
```
"Analyze this image and provide:
1. Detailed scene description
2. List all visible objects with:
   - Object name
   - Confidence level
   - Approximate location
   - Brief description
3. Environmental context
4. Any notable features or activities

Format response as structured data for processing."
```

### 4. Response Processing

**Gemini API Response**:
```json
{
  "scene_description": "Indoor office space with modern furniture...",
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "Laptop Computer",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "location": "Center desk",
      "details": "Silver MacBook Pro, open and displaying content"
    },
    {
      "name": "Coffee Mug",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "location": "Right side of desk",
      "details": "White ceramic mug with handle"
    }
  ],
  "context": "Professional workspace during daytime",
  "notable_features": ["Natural lighting", "Organized layout"]
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **App Launch** → Camera permission → Service initialization
2. **Live Preview** → Point camera at subject
3. **Analysis Trigger** → Tap capture OR enable continuous mode
4. **Processing** → Image sent to Gemini → AI analysis
5. **Results Display** → Scene description + object overlays
6. **Interaction** → View details, switch cameras, adjust settings
